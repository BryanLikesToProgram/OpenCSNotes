Foundations of Logic & Proof
	Proposition 
		Declarative statement, True or False, but never both
	Propositional Calculus
		logic that deals w/ propositions
		Predicates 
		"x is greater than 5"
		x is SUBJECT of statement
		"is greater than 5" is the PROPERTY the subject of the statement can ha∨e
		P(x), P: predicate, x is ∨ariable
		P(x) ∨alue of propositional function P at x
		once x has been assigned a ∨alue, P(x) becomes a proposition and has a truth ∨alue
				Ex.
				P(x) = "x > 100"
				P(x): x < 100
				P(5): 5 < 100, True
	Theorem
			Statement thta can be shown to be true
		Proof
			∨alid arg that establishes the truth of a Theorem
		Lemma
			Result thta is pro∨ed to help in pro∨ing a Theorem
		Corollary
			Theorem that can be established directly from a Theorem that has been pro∨en
		Conjecture
			Statement that is being proposed to be a true statement, usually based on some partial e∨idence
				 Famous Conjectures
					Fermat's Last Theorem:
						X^n + Y^n = Z^n 
						No nontrivial solution in the set of integers if n > 2
					Four Color Conjecture
						Planar graph is four colorable
	E∨en Integer
		n is e∨en if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k
	Odd Integer
		n is odd if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k+1

Quantification (predicate calculus)
	Create a proposition from a function w/o needing to assign values to variables (Similar to domain)
	"P(x) for all values of x in the domain"
	When a quantifier is used on a variable it becomes "Bound", otherwise that variable is "Free"
		All variables that occur in a propositional function must be bound or have a variable to become a proposition
	Universal quantification  ∀
			all values that are true in a certain domain
			∀xP(x)  True: P(x) is true for every x. False: There is an x for which P(x) is false (provable by counterexample)
					Ex. (x + 1 > x)
					P(x) is true for all real #'s, therefore the quantification is True
					(x < 2)
					P(x) is not true for all real #'s (P(3)), therefore the quantification is False
	Counterexample (Existential Quantifier) ∃
		all values that are false in a certain domain
		"an element for which P(x) is false is a counter example of ᗄxP(x)"
		∃xP(x)  True: There is an x for which P(x) is true.  False: P(x) is false for every x.
	It's assumed all domains of quantifiers exist
		If one is empty, then ∀xP(x) is true for any propositionalfunction P(x) 
		because there are no elements x in the domain for which P(x) is false.
	Uniqueness Quantifier
		There exists exactly one unique number/quantifier
		"There exists a unique x such that P(x) is true"
	Order of Quantifiers
		∀x∀yP(x,y): P(x, y) is true for every pair x, y
		∃x∃yP(x,y) : There is a pair x,y for which P(x, y) is true
		∀x∃yP(x,y): For every x there exists y for which P(x, y) is true
		∃y∀xQ(x,y): There is an x for which P(x, y) is true for every y
		∀x∀y∃zQ(x,y,z): There is a z such that for all x and all y is true
				Ex. (x+y = y+x)
					∀x∀yP(x,y) and ∀y∀xP(x,y)?
					P(x, y) is true for all real numbers. Therefore both are true (Both also mean the same thing)
				
					(x+y = 0)
					∀x∃yQ(x,y)?
					Given a real number x , there exists a real numbery y ( -x) such that x+y = 0.
					Therefore ∀x∃yQ(x,y) is true.

x is president of USA ⟶ (Implies) x is u.s citezen

(Direct Proof):
	x is president of USA
		⟶Must have been a pres candidate
		⟶Election Commision would have evaluated x for eligability
		⟶x must have been a US citizen
			(Otherwise Comission wouldve said otherwise based on US Constitution
		⟶x is a US citizen
Direct Proof	
	Start on left hand side, prove based on whatever facts you have

(Contraposition) 
	¬(x is a US citizen by birth)  [is not a us citizen]

1) n is even ⟶  n^2 is even
	proof 
		Direct 
			 n is even 
			 ⟶ n = 2k for same integer k
			 ⟶ n^2 = (2k^2) = 4k^2= 2(2k^2)=2(k) where k = 2k^2 (and k is an int)
			 ⟶ n^2 is even
		Contradiction...?
			n^2 is not even
			⟶ n is not even
			⟶n^2 is not even 
			⟶n^s is odd	
			⟶ n^2 = 2k+1 for some int k
					= (2k)^2 + 4k +1
					=4k^2 + 4k _1
					=2(2k^2 + 2k)+1 = K
					=2K + 1where K = 2k^2 +2k (which is an integer)
			⟶n^2 is odd
...) 2n+2 is o ⟶ n is odd
	proof:
	(Contradiction)
		¬(n is odd) ≡  n is even
			⟶ n = 2m where m is an integer
			⟶ 5n+2 = 5(2m) +2
				=2(5m+1)
				= 2k were k = 5m+1 is an int
			⟶ 5n+2 is even ≡ 7(5n+2 is odd)
3) n = ab a <=sqrt(n) or b <= sqrt(n)
	proof:
		(Contraposition) 
		¬((a <= sqrt(n))V(b<=sqrt(n)))
			=¬(a <= sqrt(n))^¬(b<=sqrt(n)) Demorgans Laws
			=(a > sqrt(n)) ^ (b < sqrt(n))
			⟶ ab > sqrt(n) * sqrt(n)
			⟶ ab != n  ≡  ¬(ab = n)
4) n^2 is odd ⟶ n is odd	
	proof:
		(Contraposition)
		¬(n is odd) ≡ n is even
			⟶n = 2m for same integer m
			⟶n^2 = (2m^2_
							= 4m^2
							= 2(2m^2)
							= 2k  where j = 2m^2(int)
			⟶n^2 is even  ≡ ¬(N^2 is odd)
			(This would be hard to prove by direct)

1) ab is even ⟶ a is even or b is even (a, b are integers)
		[if the product of two integers is even then one of them is ....]
	proof:
	(Contraposition)
		¬( a is even or b is even) = a is odd ^(or) b is odd (Demorgans Law)
				⟶(a =2m+1)n(b = 2n+1) for some int m & n
				⟶ab = (2m+1)(2n+1)
							= 4mn + 2m +2n _1
							=2(2mn +m+n) + 1
							=2k+1 where k = 2mn+m+n ⟶ ¬(ab is even)
1) sqrt(2) is n irrational number
	Proof
	(Contradiction)
		(assume the statement is not true)
		⟶ sqrt(2) is a rational number
		⟶ sqrt(2) = p/q for some integers p & q, & q != 0
			(We can assume p & q have no common factors) (*)
			(sqrt(2))^2 = p^2/q^2
		⟶  2 = p^2/q^2
		⟶ 2q^2 = p^2
		⟶ p^2 is even
		⟶ p is even ( if ab is even, then a is even or b is even)
		⟶ p is 2k for some int (2)
			Substitute p = 2k in (1)
				2q^2 = 2(2k)^2
				2q^2 = 4k^2
				q^2 = 2k^2
		⟶  q^2 is even
		⟶  q is even
		⟶ q = 2m for some int M (3)
		From (2) and (3), we see 2 is a common factor of p & q, 
		which is a contradiction to the assumption  that p & q have no common factors (*)
		So, our assumption that sqrt(2) is rational is wrong
		so sqrt(2) is irrational
2) Sum of a rational numver and an irrational number is irrational
	proof:
		(Contradiction)
		Assume this is not true
		⟶  There exists a rational number a and an irrational number b (*) such that a+b is rational
		a is rational ⟶  a = p/q fpr some integers p & q
		a +b is rational
			⟶  a + b = m/n for some integers m,n, n != 0
			⟶ p/q +b = m/n
			⟶ b = m/n -p/q + (qm -pn)/(nq)  [nq != 0]
			⟶  b is rational 
				This ^ contradicts (*)
		Our assumption is wrong, and the statement is true
		
3) Show that the following statements about an int are equivalent
	(A) n is even
	(B) n -1 is odd
	(C) n^2 is even
	proof:
		(A) ⟶  (B), (B) ⟶  (C), (C) ⟶  (A)
				or 
		(A) ⟶  (B), (B) ⟶  (A), (B) ⟶  (C), (C) ⟶ (B)
			All statements apply to eachother, should always be able to find a path
		
	To prove (A) ⟶  (B)
		n is even ⟶ n =2k
						⟶ n-1 = 2k-1
										= 2(k-1)-1+2
										= 2(k-1)+1
						⟶  n -1 is odd = (B)
	To prove (B) ⟶  (C)
		(B)  ≡ is odd
		⟶ n - 1 = 2k + 1 for some k
		⟶ n = 2k +2
		⟶n^2 = (2k+2)^2
						= (2k +2)^2
						= 4k^2 +8k + 4
						= 2(2k^2 +4k +2)
						= 2M, where M = 2k^2 + 4k + 2
		⟶ n is even ≡ (C)
	
	Prove (C) ⟶ (A)
		prove (C) ⟶ (B)
		prove(B) ⟶ (A)
		already done all of the above
		
2)  is irrational ⟶ 1/a is irrational
	proof
		(Contraposition)
			¬(1/a is irrational) ≡ 1/a is rational
			⟶ (1/a) = p/q q != 0, p != 0 (1/a != 0)
			⟶a = q/p p != 0
			⟶a is rational ≡ ¬(a is irrational)

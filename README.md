# OpenCSNotes

## Why?
  Github is actually a great ad hoc solution for sharing notes.
  * Other students can create pull requests or place issues for errors
  * Some classes require unique unicode characters which rarely are contained in a single font
    * (Information for installing specific fonts & further details can be added as needed in a centralized place)
  * The current notes can be accessed plaintext from any location with minimal setup and zero installation
    * (Most CS / Engineering majors are already familiar with using Github)
    
## Intro to Program Design Abstraction & Probelm Solving [CS215]
  Spring 2017 Semester
  
  Instructer Kevin Joiner
  
  
  Complete semester notes, still needs better formatting and organization
  
  Notes are my own interpretation of Professor Joiner's lectures & my personal experience
  
## Intro to Software Engineering Techinques [CS216]
  Fall 2019 Semester
  
  Dr. Yi L Pike 
  
  
  Semester notes are still being actively developed.
  
  Notes are my own interpretation of Dr. Pike's lectures & my own personal experience
  
## Discrete Mathmatics [CS275]
  Fall 2019 Semester
  
  Dr. D. Manivannan (Mani)
  
  Rosen, Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications
  
  
  Semester notes are still being actively developed.
  **NOTE:**
  > Logical symbols are in extremely varied sections of the Unicode Standard
  > Most fonts have limited install space and only contain a selection of Unicode Characters
  > Review of these notes may require installation of a font that supports these specific Symbols
  > My reccomendation is "Evertype" (www.evertype.com) as it's readable, simple to install & monospaced
  
  Notes are my own interpretation of Dr. Manivannan's lectures, textbook information, & my own personal experience
  
## Design of Logic Circuits [EE280]
  Fall 2019 Semester
  
  Dr. Jeffrey Ashley
  
  Brown, Vranesic, Fundamentals of Digital Logic
  
  
  Coming Soon....
  > I need a way to visualize gate logic & circuit design in text
  
   Notes are my own interpretation of Dr. Ashley's lectures, textbook information, & my own personal experience

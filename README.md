# OpenCSNotes

## Why?
  Github is actually a great ad hoc solution for sharing notes.
  * Other students can create pull requests or place issues for errors
  * Some classes require unique unicode characters which rarely are contained in a single font
    * (Information for installing specific fonts & further details can be added as needed in a centralized place)
  * The current notes can be accessed plaintext from any location with minimal setup and zero installation
    * (Most CS / Engineering majors are already familiar with using Github)
